# Wise Butterfly
### Terrain Path Algorithm

Watch in awe as you experience the wise butterfly conserve energy as it figures out the lowest path (give or take) through procedurally generated terrain.

In real time, the butterfly loops through all particle positions in the world.
It collects all positions within a certain range of it.
Then it reduces the collections even further by determining which of the positions are in the butterfly's forward direction.
Finally, figure out which one of the surviving positions is the lowest on the y-axis.
